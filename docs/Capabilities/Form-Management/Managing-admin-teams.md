To manage your form and its submissions, you have the option to add team members with an IDIR account. Additionally, you can add Basic BCeID users with the role of form submitter, and BCeID Business users with roles including submitter, submission reviewer, and team manager.

## Adding new team member
1. Go to the Team Management page to configure role-based access for your team.
2. Click the `Add a team member` icon, then search for the user by their IDIR or name. Note that team members must have logged in to CHEFS at least once before they can be added to your team.
