## Import a form design
<!-- **[Back to top](#top)** -->

To import an example form, or one of your own exported forms:

1. Hit the 'Import' button
2. Find the JSON file on your computer
3. Hit 'Open'

The imported form will load into the designer. **Be careful**, the imported form will **replace** anything you've started so you may want to import into a newly created form.

## Export a form design
<!-- **[Back to top](#top)** -->

To export a form:

1. Hit the 'Export' button
2. Save the JSON file to your computer

Exporting forms is a great way to copy an existing design or share it with others.


## Creating a form using JSON with minimum fields.
CHEFS Form.io platform provides a visual form builder that lets you drag and drop form elements, and automatically generates the corresponding JSON schema for you. Every component and layouts in CHEFS are represented as JSON in the background.

If for any reason if you would like to create the forms using the JSON Schema instead of visual form builder, below are some JSON schemas for some components with minimum mandatory variables and full schema.

|Form |Minimum Schema|Full schema|
|---|---|---|
|[Basic components with Layouts](https://submit.digital.gov.bc.ca/app/form/submit?f=0da54bf6-2951-4579-8426-76565137f395)|[Minimum Schema JSON file](examples/minimum_schema_JSON_file.json)|[Full Schema JSON file](examples/full_schema_JSON_file.json)|

Once the desired JSON file is ready follow above metioned [guidelines](#import-a-form-design) to import it into the form designer.
